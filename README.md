My first web development project, a simple HTML only website, has been an enlightening journey. Here's a summary of the skills and knowledge I've acquired:

**Linux and Bash Proficiency:**
- Mastered navigating the Linux file system using Bash commands.
- Gained experience in copying, creating, and moving files within the terminal.

**Git Version Control:**
- Learned essential Git commands:
  - `git add`: Stages changes for the next commit.
  - `git commit`: Records staged changes with a descriptive message.
  - `git push origin main`: Pushes local commits to the remote repository's main branch.
  - `git log`: Displays the commit history.
- Understood best practices for writing meaningful commit messages, adhering to the seven conventional rules.

**HTML Fundamentals:**
- Developed a standard HTML boilerplate to structure web pages effectively.
- Utilized various heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to establish content hierarchy.
- Integrated images using the `<img>` tag and added hyperlinks with the `<a>` tag.
- Distinguished between absolute and relative links, applying each appropriately.

This foundational experience has equipped me with the necessary tools to advance further in web development.
