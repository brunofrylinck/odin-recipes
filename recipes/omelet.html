        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butteer or oil</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 class="heading-section">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="text list">
        <li><strong>Prepare the eggs:</strong> Crack the egs into a bowl and whisk with a pinch of salt
            and pepper until fully combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the pan:</strong> Place a non-stick skillet or frying pan on medium heat. 
            Add the butter or oil and let it melt, swirling it around to coat the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the eggs:</strong> Pour the beaten eggs into the pan. Let them cook undisturbed for 
            about 1-2 minutes until the edges start to set.</li>
        <li><strong>Add fillings (optional):</strong> If you're adding fillings like cheese or veggies, sprinkle 
            them over half of the omelet now.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold the omelet:</strong> Once the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top, 
            use a spatula to gently fold the omelet in half.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish cooking:</strong> Let the omelet cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute, 
            or until fully set but still soft inside.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Slide the omelet onto a plate and enjoy!</li>
